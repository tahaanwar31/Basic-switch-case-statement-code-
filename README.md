FAST NUCES , First Semester ,Lab 04 .

This code is the solution to the question assigned to me in my 4th Programming Fundamentals Lab during the first semester of my BS in Computer Science.

Question:Q4. Write a program to control a coffee machine. Allow the user to input the type of coffee as B for
Black and W for White. Ask the user if the cup size is double and if the coffee is manual. The following
table details the time chart for the machine for each coffee type. Display a statement for each step. If
the coffee size is double, increase the baking time by 50 percent. Use functions to display instructions to
the user and to compute the coffee time.
